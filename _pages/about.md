Harry is a No.10 AI Fellow at 10 Downing Street, working with the newly established [Incubator of AI](https://ai.gov.uk/), and a Research Scientist at the [UK AI Safety Institute](https://www.aisi.gov.uk/). With a PhD in Artificial Intelligence from Imperial College London, Harry advises on and leads AI projects addressing Prime Minister priority issues. His work spans from evaluating emerging foundation model capabilities in agentic settings to exploring robust AI for healthcare applications. As a Visiting Lecturer at Imperial College London, Harry co-delivers the Deep Learning Course in the Department of Computing.


Harry's PhD research focused on characterising and controlling for bias in high-dimensional medical deep learning settings and self-supervised learning in high dimensional settings. He has also spent time seconded to [The Alan Turing Institue](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) as a Research Scientist, where his work led to a first-author paper in [Nature Machine Intelligence](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-023-00773-8). Prior to his current roles, Harry founded Maat, an AI biomedical due diligence consultancy. Maat, which had high-profile clients such as Pfizer, Candesic, and Tachyon Ventures, was closed down in November 2023 to avoid conflict of interest issues with his governmental roles.
